# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am postdoctoral researcher at [Universität Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/). I am part of the [Signal Processing Team](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/sp/home.html) supervised by [Pr. Dr.-Ing. Timo Gerkmann](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/sp/people/gerkmann.html). My research interests include speech enhancement, audio-visual signal processing and machine learning. <br> I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from INRIA and the Université de Lorraine (Nancy, France), where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Emmanuel Vincent](https://members.loria.fr/EVincent/) and [Dr. Romain Serizel](https://members.loria.fr/RSerizel/) on speech enhancement for hands-free telecommunication devices. The PhD thesis covers joint reduction of acoustic echo, reverberation and noise. </br>
